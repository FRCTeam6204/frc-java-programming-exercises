# Programming FRC Robots in Java
To [get started](../README.md) programming FRC robots in Java, you'll need Eclipse and WPILib. The instructions for installing these are on the home page README.

If you're new to programming in WPILib, check out [this tutorial](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/13809/l/145307?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13809) to easily get started. These challenges require at least having done that tutorial, and might need a little searching documentation or reading WPILib source code to complete.

##### 1. Create a basic robot movement program using a joystick or Xbox controller.
Movement is the most important aspect of the robot – mastering this is essential.

##### 2. If your robot has other (non-movement) motors (add some!), map some buttons/joysticks to control them.
For example, a climbing mechanism could have one button for forward, and one for backward, or an Xbox controller stick axis devoted to controlling it at different speeds and directions. You can also incorporate our [driver station interface](https://github.com/FRCTeam6204/dshardware).

##### 3. Write a simple autonomous program.
Simple movement is a good starting point. You can increase its complexity from there, including different directions, turns, and speeds – teach your robot to dance!

##### 4. Write a more complex autonomous program.
Try programming the robot to navigate a course, possibly using sensors. Include different states, and observe the different ways you can increase precision and adaptability of the robot.
